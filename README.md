# smartest-repo
This repository is to revive SmarTest tool and build a new version of the tool with more cool features. The first version was built couple of years ago at Brillio.

The idea is to build a holistic testing tool that can perform testing on different layers of a given application such as UI, API, Security etc.

The types of testing that we plan to integrate into the platform are Functional testing at UI and API levels, Performance testing using APIs, Security testing using APIs, Visual testing, accessbility testing, localization and internationalization testing and compliance testing.

Team will analyse the existing code base and come up with plan to upgrade the components with newer tech stack, post which, we will start building additional components for different types of testing listed above.
